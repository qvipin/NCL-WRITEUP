 # ⛳️ CTF/Cybersecurity ASSETS AND WRITEUP'S
All of my Capture The Flag (CTF) assets, including write-ups, files, and so forth, the other one repositories's with write-ups specific to the CTF have been archived. These resources, along with others' CTF Writeup's I wrote, have been imported from my Notion, which may result in slight markdown discrepancies. For my preferred CTF write-ups, including those from TryHackMe (THM), HackTheBox (HTB), blogs, and CyberStudent CTF (CSD CTF) materials, please visit my website @ [vipinb.xyz/blog](https://vipinb.xyz/blog). 

Creator's Note: To all freshmen and other students attending my school (you will recognize if you attend), the answers to the NCL Gym and other CTFs we engage in are provided here, offering the potential to secure your position on the Cyberpatriots team or aid in cheating. However, it is your prerogative how you choose to employ this information. I strongly encourage you to view these write-ups as valuable learning tools. The knowledge shared here is substantial, and I hope you will refrain from simply copying the answers without comprehending the underlying concepts.

Update 05/09/24: Now includes cybersecurity assets too.
